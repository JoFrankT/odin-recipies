    <h2 class="text">Description</h2>
        <p class="text">In the mountainous regions of Ecuador people love to eat roast cuy (rhymes with gooey). A cuy is a guinea pig raised for meat. Ecuadorians raise them in small pens, caring for them until they’re large enough to make a good meal. That could be a few weeks or a little longer. No matter how long, each guinea is eventually headed to the grill.</p>
    <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="text bullet">
            <li>One whole guinea pig, cleaned and gutted</li>
            <li>Achiote Paste</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Cumin</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Chiles</li>
            <li>Beer</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h2 class="text">Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="text bullet">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit</li>
            <li>Rub the guinea pig all over with salt, pepper, achiote paste, garlic, cumin, oregano, and chiles. </li>
            <li>Place the guinea pig in a roasting pan and pour beer over it. Bake for one to two hours, or until the guinea pig is cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">Now that you know how to make cuy asado, you might be wondering how to eat it! The best way to eat cuy is by picking it up with your hands and tearing off pieces of meat. You can also use a knife and fork, but be warned – it can be quite messy! Cuy asado is typically served with potatoes, rice, plantains, and a salad. It is also common to see people eating cuy with their hands, so don’t be afraid to get messy!</p>
